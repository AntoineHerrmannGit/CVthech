The aim is to simulate classical spins dynamics in the extended micromagnetic model with temperature effects
including the following interactions : RKKY, DMI, Anisotropy, Zeeman, Dipole-dipole, Rashba SOC

The final aim is to model topological charge emergence and transport in various crystals and sample geometries for skyrmion-based computing.
